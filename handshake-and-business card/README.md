### Description 

A playful illustrated portfolio introducing Diana Huong Nguyen, combining dance and graphic design with a personal, hand-drawn style.





### Process, iterations & simple story

Step 1 – Initial idea

I wanted the page to feel personal and friendly, so I chose a hand-drawn illustration instead of a polished digital design.

Step 2 – First version

The first version focused mainly on the character illustration, but it felt too empty and didn’t communicate who I am.

Step 3 – Adding context

I added handwritten text with my name, roles, and contact details to clearly introduce myself and my creative work.

Step 4 – Refinement

Small doodles like bears, stars, and hearts were added to guide the eye and create a playful visual rhythm without overwhelming the content.


### Final result

The final image tells a simple story: a creative person inviting viewers into her world, showing personality, skills, and how to get in touch.
